Project Title: HealthHubFinder

Objective: The HealthHubFinder project aims to develop a web-based application that helps users search, evaluate, and find the best hospitals in their region based on various criteria, including specialty, patient reviews, location, and facilities. In addition to hospital search capabilities, the platform also allows hospital administrators or users to add new hospitals to the system, contributing to an expanding database of healthcare facilities.

Overview: HealthHubFinder will be a fully functional PHP-based application utilizing a relational database postgres for data storage. The application will provide users with the ability to search for hospitals by location, specialty, and other key parameters. Furthermore, users will be able to review hospitals based on their experiences. The system will be designed to allow hospital management or authorized users to add new hospitals to the platform, providing an up-to-date listing of healthcare facilities.

Features:

    Search Functionality:
        Users can search hospitals based on location, medical specialties (e.g., cardiology, pediatrics, orthopedics), patient ratings, or services provided.
        Filters will allow users to narrow down results by proximity, hospital type, and patient ratings.

    Hospital Details Page:
        Each hospital listing will display detailed information, such as address, contact details, specialties, services, user reviews, and available facilities.
        Users can also view hospital ratings and detailed reviews from other patients to make informed decisions.

    Add New Hospital:
        A feature will allow authorized users (hospital administrators or registered users) to add new hospitals to the system.
        The form will include fields such as hospital name, location, specialties, contact information, and hospital description.
        Upon submission, the new hospital details will be reviewed and approved by an admin before being published on the site.

    User Authentication:
        Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
        Users can leave reviews and rate hospitals based on their experiences.

    Admin Panel:
        Admins will have access to an admin panel to manage hospital listings, approve newly added hospitals, and moderate reviews to ensure they meet platform guidelines.
        Admins can update, edit, or delete hospital entries if necessary.

Technology Stack:

    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React or vanilla JS)
    Backend: PHP  8 (for server-side scripting)
    Database: postgres for storing user information, hospital details, reviews, and ratings
    Web Server: Apache or Nginx
    Authentication: PHP Sessions or JWT for managing user login and registration
    Frameworks: codeilgnator,vscode (optional for MVC structure)

Use Case Scenario:

    User: John is searching for a cardiologist hospital near his location. He uses the HealthHubFinder search functionality to filter hospitals by specialty and rating. After reading user reviews and comparing hospitals, he selects one with the best reviews.
    Hospital Admin: Dr. Smith, who works at a newly established hospital, logs into the platform and adds their hospital's details to HealthHubFinder for more exposure.

Conclusion: HealthHubFinder is a comprehensive solution for users to find the best hospitals based on personalized criteria while also providing a platform for hospitals to expand their reach. The application will create a community of patients, hospital staff, and administrators working together to improve the healthcare experience by making hospital information easily accessible and up-to-date.

2. Class Diagram

The Class Diagram outlines the structure of the system by showing its classes, attributes, methods, and relationships between classes.
Key Classes:

    User (attributes: userID, username, password, email, role)
        Methods: register(), login(), updateProfile()
    Hospital (attributes: hospitalID, name, location, specialty, description)
        Methods: addHospital(), updateHospital(), viewHospitalDetails()
    Review (attributes: reviewID, userID, hospitalID, rating, comments)
        Methods: submitReview(), editReview(), deleteReview()
    Admin (attributes: adminID, username, password)
        Methods: approveHospital(), deleteHospital(), moderateReviews()

Relationships:

    A User can submit many Reviews.
    A Hospital can have many Reviews.
    An Admin oversees Users and Hospitals.

3. Activity Diagram

The Activity Diagram shows the workflow of specific activities and how different actions flow in the system.
User Registration Flow:

    Start
    User enters registration details (name, email, password)
    System validates data
    User is added to the database
    Confirmation email sent to user
    User logs in to the system
    End

Hospital Addition Flow (Admin):
